                            <td id="textop">Between 1964 and 1972, Wilson Pickett established himself as one of the best soul men of all time with a series of successes
                                incendiary pop and R&B like In the Midnight Hour, Land of 1,000 Dances, <br> Mustang Sally and Funky Broadway. <br> But the scorching career of
                                Wicked Pickett did not stop when he left Atlantic Records. <br> Beginning with Mr. Magic Man of 1973, Pickett recorded four studio albums
                                poignant for RCA Records, where, in two extremely productive years, <br> achieved its latest Hot 100 hits, as well as a series of hits
                                in the R&B lists. However, Pickett's RCA discography has been almost ignored in the era of compact discs. Now, Real Gone Music and
                                Second Disc Records are proud to present Wilson's first four sparkling and funky RCA studio dishes on CD.
                                Pickett in Mr. Magic Man: The Complete RCA Studio Recordings. This 2 CD package includes Mr. Magic Man (1973), Miz Lena s Boy (1973), Pickett
                                in the Pocket (1974) and Join Me and Let s Be Free (1975) plus four rare bonuses, <br> never on single CDs to paint a full portrait of this
                                exciting was. For these sessions, Pickett partnered with producers such as Brad Shapiro, Dave Crawford and Yusuf Rahman, and recorded in legendary places
                                or Muscle Shoals Sound and Sigma Sound Studios in Philadelphia, where Pickett had <br> recorded some of its most indelible sides of the Atlantic. The collection
                                 takes his title from the hit single written by the team of Bobby Eli and Vinnie <br> Barrett (Sideshow, Love Won t Let Me Wait) that captured Pickett in a
                                 Philly's smooth rhythm. Vic Anesini at Sony Battery Studios has remastered this unique collection of its kind, while Joe Marchese has written the
