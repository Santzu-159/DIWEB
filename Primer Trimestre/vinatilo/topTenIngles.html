                                    John Bonham, John Paul Jones, Jimmy Page and Robert Plant formed Led Zeppelin in 1968. In the next decade the band became

                                    fans of all ages across the planet. It doesn't matter how many times you have listened to his music because Led Zeppelin has never sounded

                                y que siempre mantendrán su valor.

                                Algunos de estos discos antiguos, hay que decir, contienen música que es pobre, pero Peter Howell y John Ferdinando lanzaron 
                                Cuatro álbumes bajo cuatro nombres diferentes.

                                Los arreglos maravillosos de las canciones Fly Away y otros LPs como Ithaca’s A Game For All Who Know siguen siendo 
                                santos griales para coleccionistas.

                                and that they will always maintain their value.

                                    This vinyl record is already valued at around € 800, although everything will depend on the state of the disc. In any case, it is a known psychedelic jewel.

                                     However, like Vashti Bunyan and Elias Hulk's albums that are in a similar price range, or Leafhound’s Growers by
                                     Mushroom in a higher range, a copy of this album in perfect condition will keep due to demand among collectors.
                                    
                                     The fraction of copies that are in an optimal condition is very low. Despite a recent reissue, the demand for this LP is not going to
                                     disappear for at least a decade and will remain on the list of the most wanted vinyl for some time.

                                     Copies of Rod Stewart's Gravy Train’s Ballad for A Peaceful Man or An Old Raincoat Won’t Let You Down have been sold for prices
